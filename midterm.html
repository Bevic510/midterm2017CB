<p><h1><b><u>Manchego</u></b></h1></p>
<p><h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4></p>

<p><h4><b>Manchego</b>(officially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>: <i>queso manchego</i> pronounced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish">[ˈkeso maɲˈtʃeɣo])</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese">cheese</a> made in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mancha">La Mancha </a>region of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mancha">Spain</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_milk">milk</a> of sheep of the<i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchega">manchega</a></i> breed. Official <i>manchego </i>cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years.
<i>Manchego</i> has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep's milk.
The designation<i> queso manchego</i>is protected under Spain's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominaci%C3%B3n_de_Origen">
s
Denominación de Origen (DO)</a> regulatory classification system,[2] and the cheese has been granted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union"> Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)</a> status by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">
European Union.[3] </a></h4></p>

<p><h3>To be designated as <i>queso manchego</i>, the cheese must satisfy the following requirements:</h3></p>

<ul><h3>
<li>It must have been produced in an area that is restricted to designated parts of the provinces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Albacete"> Albacete</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Ciudad_Real"> Ciudad Real</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Cuenca">


 Cuenca</a>, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Toledo"> Toledo</a> that lie within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mancha"> La Mancha</a> region.</li>

<li>It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the manchega breed that are raised on registered farms within the designated area.</li>

<li>The cheese must have been aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to 1.5 kg or 3.3 lb) and a maximum of two years.</li>

<li>The cheese must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of 12 cm (4.7 in) and a maximum diameter of 22 cm (8.7 in).</li>

</ul></p>
<p><h3><i>Manchego</i> cheese can be made from pasteurised or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk">raw milk</a>; if the latter, it may be labelled as <i>artesano</i> (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet">rennet</a> or another approved coagulating enzyme, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"> sodium chloride</a>
 (salt).</h3></p>

<p><b><u><h2 id="Manufacturing and labelling">Manufacturing and labelling</h2></u></b></h2></p>
<p><h3>The moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally,<i> manchego</i> cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esparto">esparto</a> grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as <i>pleita</i>) on the rind.[1] Today the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of an ear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"> </a>wheat.
During the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat">paraffin</a>, dipped in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil">olive oil</a>, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.
Cheeses that meet the DO requirements carry a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein">casein</a> tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend <i>queso manchego</i>, a serial number, and artwork depicting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote"> Don Quixote de La Mancha</a>.[5]
A cheese that is similar to manchego and made in the same region, but from a blend of cow's, goat's, and ewe's milk, is sold as queso <i>ibérico</i> or <i>ibérico cheese</i>.</h3></p>

<p><b><u><h2 id="Varieties">Varieties</h2></u></b></h2></p>
<p><h3><i>Manchego</i> has variety of different flavours depending on its age. There are four versions of maturity sold:[6][7][8]</h3></p>

<ul><h3>
<li><bold>Fresco</bold> – the fresh cheese is aged for only 2 weeks, with a rich but mild flavour; technically not a true queso manchego due to its lack of ageing.[9] Produced in small </li>
quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain.

<li><bold>Semicurado</bold> is a semi-firm cheese aged for three weeks to 3-4 months, somewhat milder than curado.</li>

<li><bold>Curado</bold> is a semi-firm cheese aged for three to six months with a caramel and nutty flavour.</li>

<li><bold>Viejo</bold>, aged for one to two years, is firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged; it has a rich deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas">tapas</a>.[10]</li>
</h3></ul>

In Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, <i>manchego</i> or <i>queso tipo manchego</i> (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to a cow's milk cheese similar in taste to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Jack">Monterey Jack</a>. It melts well and is used as both a table cheese and for cooking. Apart from the name, this cheese has little in common with the Spanish variety.[11]</h3></p>

<p><b><u><h2 id="Central America">Central America</h2></u></b></h2></p>
<p><h3>In Costa Rica, three companies (Dos Pinos, Los Alpes[12] and Monteverde) produce a manchego-type cheese (queso tipo manchego) which can come with a drawing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">
 Don Quijote</a> on the labels. One company also makes a manchego-type cheese with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil">basil</a> added. These Costa-Rican cheeses can come dipped in paraffin, and some have the <i>pleita</i> pattern pressed on the side.</h3></p>
